# Current State​

Within the BC Public Sector civil servants have no one single landing zone for community contributed shared experience knowledge.​

# Impact​

When a new employee begins with the Public Service they are sent to multiple web sites and resources when  looking for best practices and guidance. This costs time and creates frustration.  Using search engines may lead to hints and tricks, much of which is not directly applicable.​

# Desired State​

Research, identify and prototype a single trusted landing space where employees can share collective experiences. Use this knowledge to engage Communities of Practice for their feedback in order to further refine the problem..
