In an era where applications and solutions are required to come to the market with very tight timelines it is no longer possible to rely on developing for “perfection”, instead, solutions are often launched that are designed to meet initial user needs and if the product is adopted/accepted by users/clients/customers the product can be iterated and improved as long as it is valued.

Traditional models such as ‘waterfall’ which often would run over multi-year project plans are no longer desirable. Instead taking an Agile approach will deliver a client-focused product sooner or it will end work in a product that is not required/desired before a lot of resources are invested.

When developing the actual product, the 'traditional' (ie" waterfall) approach often empowered a small group of people to make critical decisions about how a product would work. A lot of effort would then be put into creating a prototype (usually) followed by user-testing and eventual product launch or abandonment. This was a costly and often frustrating approach. The alternative is to take a Human-Centered Design approach. [IDEO](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/how-ideo-uses-customer-insights-to-design-innovative-products-users-love) defines human centered design as a creative approach to problem-solving that starts with people and ends with innovative solutions that are tailor-made to suit their needs.

## 1)  Agile vs Waterfall (Project Management)
### Background  
Agile and Waterfall are two popular project management methodologies. Agile is a system where team members work on different stages simultaneously and waterfall requires teams to complete one stage before moving on to the next one in a linear system.  
### Agile Pros and Cons
#### Pros
-Frequent stakeholder interaction with client-facing methodology where the team shares progress and incorporates feedback into the process  
-High flexibility can change projects direction and experiment with new directions  
-Short term deadlines encourage productivity and efficiency  
#### Cons
-Potential overlap of work in later stages if earlier phases need to be modified  
-Hard for team to be on same page because deliverables are not a requirement to proceed to next phase so team can all be at different stages  
-Project timeline is difficult to determine from the start  
### Waterfall Pros and Cons
#### Pros
-Concrete plan from start to finish  
-Saves time because project requirements are established early on  
-Structured workflow because each stage requires a deliverable to progress to next stage  
#### Cons
-Longer process because each stage needs to be completed before moving on  
-Timely because you might realize an issue after you’ve moved on to the next stage  
-No flexibility due to the outline from start to finish before the project begins  
### Comparison
Timeline - waterfall has a fixed timeline while agile is flexible because you can go back and switch directions.  
Client Involvement - waterfall project goals are made at the beginning then there is no further client involvement, agile includes client feedback at every stage.  
Flexibility - with waterfall, each stage needs to completed before moving on, while agile has short bursts of work made for changing directions.  
Budget - waterfall has a fixed budget while agile is open to adaptation with a flexible budget.  
### Conclusion
We chose to follow agile practices for this project because we value the flexibility it provides in both timeline and the direction the project goes in. The influence of client involvement in agile is also highly valued.

## 2)	Human-Centered Design vs Requirements Based Design
### Background  
Human centered design defined by [IDEO](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/how-ideo-uses-customer-insights-to-design-innovative-products-users-love): a creative approach to problem-solving that starts with people and ends with innovative solutions that are tailor-made to suit their needs. With requirement based design there is no regard to the fact people will use the system, it only matters that the functional requirements are met.  Wikipedia defines requirements-based design as a tenant of requirements engineering including 'the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process'. 

## Human-Centered Design Pros and Cons
#### Pros
-more effective, safer projects  
-users feel sense of ownership in products  
-more assistance in users expectations of products  
#### Cons
-user centered is expensive  
-difficult to translate certain types of data into design  
-user research is timely so product can take more time  
-item may be too complicated and specific for public use leading to becoming more expensive  
### Requirements Based Design Pros and Cons  
#### Pros
-Design is based on the systems needs, system will be functional and reliable  
-less time and money spent on research  
#### Cons
-little regard that people will use the system  
-users might not be as happy with product or have usage issues  
### Comparison
Human-Centered is for the user while Design is based on the system. The use of each is dependent on the purpose of what you are creating. The majority of the time the general users will be people, making human-centered design more desirable.
### Conclusion
We chose human-centered design because our product will be used by general government employees and we want them to have the best user experience possible.

## 3)  Material UI
### Background 
Material design is a set of style guidelines. Rule set to handle design situations. 
### Pros
-	Smooth UI transitions and animations between elements (can be used for movement on screen or highlighting buttons ect…)
-	Fast page switching, animations, fast screen scrolling and content updates
-	Self contained UI components that are reusable and packed with API styles for your use.
-	Responsive to different page sizes (for example if have a small screen size)
-	Takes less time to make animations since elements are standardized within a webpage
-	Customizable by colour, graphics, typography, ect… you can choose the correct fit for you
-	Has a robust component library
-	Has extensive icon library
-	Good documentation in framework with examples
-	Works well with react
### Cons
-	Objects on page move when you do certain actions, for example scrolling down
-	Requires a learning curve. 
-	Easily identifiable with its increasing popularity
-	Made by google, so primary for people who use google or android
### Conclusion 
Material UI is an easy and simple way to create and standardize components to be used later on in the code.

## 4)  Tooling (Adobe XD vs Figma)
### Background 
Figma and Adobe XD are vector editing tools for UX/UI designers.  
### Adobe XD Pros and Cons
#### Pros
-screen sharing abilities  
-easy for users to learn and interact with  
-design tool  
-many exporting options  
-works on mobile app platforms  
#### Cons
-download and purchase plan  
-less language options (ex: English)  
-compatible with less operating systems  
### Figma Pros and Cons  
#### Pros
-no installation (just website)  
-screen sharing abilities  
-prototyping tool  
-software in many different languages (ex: English)  
-compatible with more operating systems  
#### Cons
-does not work on mobile app platforms  
-less exporting options  
### Comparison
Figma and Adobe XD are similar and have many of the same qualities, the main differences being Figma’s language choices and operating system compatibility and Adobe XD’s user friendly platform and working on mobile apps.  
### Conclusion
Our team chose Adobe XD because it is easier to learn and use, and for a short 4 month project there was not much time to become familiar with the tool. The exporting options and screen sharing abilities were pros. Many of the Figma pros were not as important to our project.
