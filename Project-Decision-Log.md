In an era where applications and solutions are required to come to the market with very tight timelines it is no longer possible to rely on developing for “perfection”, instead, solutions are often launched that are designed to meet initial user needs and if the product is adopted/accepted by users/clients/customers the product can be iterated and improved as long as it is valued.

The consumerization of information technology has led to an app driven world where every product now has a digital component. These products are released to the market in marketplaces known as app stores or on websites. Where in the past an army of sales and marketing staff would develop sales strategies to raise awareness today's products are advertised and sold using multiple channels and often supported by social media campaigns.  Funding these products is often through start-up backers with initial seed money. If a product establishes itself then can be improved or launch an associated product or service.

Taking a platform approach is similar to creating a business model which relies on composable services exposed as APIs.
Traditional models such as ‘waterfall’ which often would run over multi-year project plans are no longer desirable. Instead taking an Agile approach will deliver a client-focused product sooner or it will end work in a product that is not required/desired before a lot of resources are invested.

### Understanding the strengths weaknesses of Agile vs Waterfall when managing a new product development project.

Scrum etc 

When developing the actual product a traditional approach often empowered a small group of people to make critical decisions about how a product would work. A lot of effort would then be put into creating a prototype usually followed by user testing and eventual product launch or abandonment. This was a costly and often frustrating approach. The alternative is to take a Human-Centered Design approach…..

1)	Project Management
2)	Requirements Gathering

## 1)  Agile vs Waterfall (Project Management)
### Background  
Agile and Waterfall are two popular project management methodologies. Agile is a system where team members work on different stages simultaneously and waterfall requires teams to complete one stage before moving on to the next one in a linear system.  
### Agile Pros and Cons
#### Pros
-Frequent stakeholder interaction with client-facing methodology where the team shares progress and incorporates feedback into the process  
-High flexibility can change projects direction and experiment with new directions  
-Short term deadlines encourage productivity and efficiency  
#### Cons
-Potential overlap of work in later stages if earlier phases need to be modified  
-Hard for team to be on same page because deliverables are not a requirement to proceed to next phase so team can all be at different stages  
-Project timeline is difficult to determine from the start  
### Waterfall Pros and Cons
#### Pros
-Concrete plan from start to finish  
-Saves time because project requirements are established early on  
-Structured workflow because each stage requires a deliverable to progress to next stage  
#### Cons
-Longer process because each stage needs to be completed before moving on  
-Timely because you might realize an issue after you’ve moved on to the next stage  
-No flexibility due to the outline from start to finish before the project begins  
### Comparison
Timeline - waterfall has a fixed timeline while agile is flexible because you can go back and switch directions.  
Client Involvement - waterfall project goals are made at the beginning then there is no further client involvement, agile includes client feedback at every stage.  
Flexibility - with waterfall, each stage needs to completed before moving on, while agile has short bursts of work made for changing directions.  
Budget - waterfall has a fixed budget while agile is open to adaptation with a flexible budget.  
### Conclusion
We chose to follow agile practices for this project because we value the flexibility it provides in both timeline and the direction the project goes in. The influence of client involvement in agile is also highly valued.

## 3)  Material UI
Material design is a set of style guidelines. Rule set to handle design situations. 
### Pros
-	Smooth UI transitions and animations between elements (can be used for movement on screen or highlighting buttons ect…)
-	Fast page switching, animations, fast screen scrolling and content updates
-	Self contained UI components that are reusable and packed with API styles for your use.
-	Responsive to different page sizes (for example if have a small screen size)
-	Takes less time to make animations since elements are standardized within a webpage
-	Customizable by colour, graphics, typography, ect… you can choose the correct fit for you
-	Has a robust component library
-	Has extensive icon library
-	Good documentation in framework with examples
-	Works well with react
### Cons
-	Objects on page move when you do certain actions, for example scrolling down
-	Requires a learning curve. 
-	Easily identifiable with its increasing popularity
-	Made by google, so primary for people who use google or android
### Conclusion 
Material UI is an easy and simple way to create and standardize components to be used later on in the code.
