# Strategies 

Strategies are narratives that describe how specific Journeys translate into features as part of our solution design. 
They are based on pre-identified User Stories. To implement our intended solution the HWP team has identified five feature groupings that require strategies to be documented.

* User
* Community
* Moderator
* Admin
* Search

## User

A user is a platform member who requires an account, logs on with a valid identity, has a profile, and can customize user preferences (settings). 
A user can join or leave a community. A user can create a topic (ie: a Post). Users can also comment on posts from other community members.  A user can flag a post or comment if they feel it is controversial.

## Community 

A community is a collection of users who share a common interest and can post topics and comments within their community. Communities can be created by users. Only Administrators can remove Communities.

## Moderator

A community-moderator is a community member who has been approved by the (system-)Administrator and can add/remove users to a community.

The community moderator features are displayed in the Moderator page.

## Admin

A (system-)Administrator is a 'super'-user role who has the ability to add/remove users, promote [and remove] users to the community moderators role. 
An Administrator can adjudicate 'flagged' users and posts (ie: activate or remove a 'flagged' user or post. 

The Admin features are displayed by the Admin page.

## Search

The platform includes a search facility allows users to: 
* search all posts and comments based on key-word matches, if the user is not a member of the community that is matched they will have the ability to join the community
* search for user names within a community they are a member of [limited to that scope]

Search returns results in the Search Screen.

Features are described on the [Actions and Roles] (https://github.com/bcgov/CITZ-HybridWorkplace/wiki/7.Security) page.
